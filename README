"Cache Simulator for Visualizing Cache Behavior"


Generator for memory access events: McTracer
===================================================


mctracer-vg370.patch was a patch for the original source of valgrind 3.7.0
and contained the mctracer-tool. This tool was made to relay memory accesses
to an external program, e.g. a cache simulator, over shared memory.

Installation
------------

Requirements:
* "Current" linux distro
* "gcc" (C-Compiler), "automake" installed
* Git 

Installation:
git clone https://github.com/bucjac/ETI-GP-SS12-P5.git PROJECTPATH
cd PROJECTPATH
./init.sh

Instead of letting init.sh take care of the building, you can do it manually.
cd valgrind-source
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=<Install path for valgrind>
make
make install
cd ..
cd example
make
cd ..

Note: The valgrind makefiles choke on CC="ccache gcc"


Using mctracer as a valgrind module
-----------------------------------
Using mctracer is only possible with adjustments to your code. Without
information on size and structure of memory areas being used in the simulation,
no meaningfull analysis can be made.
The valgrind client calls that are used for this are documented in the user
documentation.

Testing:

 valgrind --tool=mctracer example/redblack

This instructs valgrind to run mctracer and the heat distribution simulation
redblack. mctracer will collect infomation on accesses on the memory area which
is used for the simulation. McTracer will save the result of its analysis to
./redblack.etis
That file can be viewed with ./gui/dist/EtiGP.jar


Viel Spass,
