\subsection{Goal}
Nowadays programmers face the following situation, when they try to optimize the memory performance of their programs: An access to a formerly unknown memory location is very expensive, it can take more than a 100 processor cycles to be completed. However, caches can reduce this time to under 10 cycles for a small subset of the memory. That means, while a programmer can not see that a cache is being used, it's very important to use it efficiently, the difference can make up 90\% of your computation time.\newline
To simplify this, a programmer needs tools. This specific tool we've developed is specialized on algorithms that work on two-dimensional matrices. It tries to visualize regions, access types and patterns so a programmer can decide which part of his algorithm is well-designed in regard to caches.
