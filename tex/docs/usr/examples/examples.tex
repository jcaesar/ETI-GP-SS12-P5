In this section, we will look at some of the matrix problems which this tool is designed for, and different algorithms solving them. We will show how to modify a debuggee so as to be able to analyze it with the tool.

\subsubsection*{Notes}
\begin{itemize}
\item As the examples presented here do not focus on the solution of the problem itself but should only briefly illustrate how to use this tool in practice, we make assumptions and simplifications in our models and do not treat every possible solution approach in full detail.

\item The code snippets in this section are written in C. We do not provide entire correct programs but concentrate on the relevant algorithmic parts, leaving out procedures and variable declarations if their function is clear from the context.

\item In the notation \texttt{a[i][j]}, the index \texttt{i} denotes the row (in the first dimension) and \texttt{j} denotes the column (in the second dimension).
\end{itemize}
